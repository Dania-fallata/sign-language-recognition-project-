 Building a sign language recognition app using Python, Mediapipe, and an RNN model can be a great way to leverage machine learning techniques for a practical application.

Here's an outline of the steps involved in your project:

Data Collection: Your team members collected data for sign language gestures. This data likely consists of videos or sequences of images capturing different signs.

Feature Extraction with Mediapipe: Mediapipe is a powerful library that provides various computer vision solutions, including hand tracking and pose estimation. You can use the hand tracking module in Mediapipe to extract hand landmarks or other relevant features from each frame of your collected data. These features will serve as inputs to your classification model.

Data Preprocessing and Labeling: Once you have extracted the features, you'll need to preprocess the data. This might involve normalizing the features, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and assigning labels to each sample based on the corresponding sign gesture.

Saving Data as Numpy Arrays: To feed the data into your LSTM model, you'll need to save the preprocessed data as numpy arrays. Numpy is a popular library for efficient numerical computations in Python.

LSTM Model Training: You'll design and train an RNN model, specifically an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, for sign language recognition. LSTM models are well-suited for sequence data like time series or sequential gestures. You can use libraries like Keras or PyTorch to build and train your LSTM model.

Model Evaluation: After training your model, you'll evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics. This will give you an idea of how well your model is able to recognize sign language gestures.

Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, you can deploy it as an application. You can create a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the app, either by capturing real-time video or by uploading pre-recorded videos, and get predictions for the sign language gestures.
